    <h2>What is OpenSea?</h2>
    <p>
      OpenSea is a digital asset exchange which allows you to sell or transfer assets with zero fees. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are the developer of a class of digital assets on the blockchain ("contract owner") then you are able to set a transfer fee which will be shared between the developer and OpenSea. This is how OpenSea makes money. Su Squares has set the transfer fee to 0% and we intend to keep it free for the foreseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenSea supports a variety of ways to sell digital assets, including fixed price sales, reverse auctions and bundle sales.
    </p>

    <h2>What is for sale?</h2>

    <p>The original announcement on Twitter shows the squares for sale. This includes 12 squares sold individually and four sold as a bundle.</p>
