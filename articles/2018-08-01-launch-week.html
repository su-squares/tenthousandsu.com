    <h2>What are Su Squares?</h2>

    <p>Su Squares are cute little blocks which you can purchase and then attach a picture and website link to. It will show publicly on <a href="index.html">the homepage</a>. Once you own a Su Square, it is yours and your ownership is enforced by the Ethereum blockchain. You can sell or rent your Square to other people and trade as well.</p>
    <p>We pay homage to <a target="homage" href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com">The Million Dollar Homepage</a> and <a target="homage" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co">CryptoKitties</a>.</p>

    <p>Read more on <a target="whitepaper" href="white-paper.html">the white paper</a> to learn how it works.</p>

    <h2>Initial deed offering / special offer</h2>
    <p>During launch week, anybody who purchases one square can receive an adjacent square for free. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Purchase two adjacent squares using the same Ethereum account.</li>
      <li>Personalize both squares with any picture, text and hyperlinks you like.</li>
      <li>Do not transfer your ownership of those squares ("<em>hodl</em>") for the duration of launch week.</li>
      <li>Email Su (<a target="su-email" href="mailto:Su@TenThousandSu.com?subject=Su%20Squares%20Launch%20Week&body=Hi%20Su%2C%0A%0AI%20purchased%20squares%20XXX%20and%20XXX%20using%20my%20wallet%20address%20XXX.%20Please%20refund%20my%20money%20for%20the%20launch%20week%20deal.%20And%20happy%20anniversary!">Su@TenThousandSu.com</a>) and provide details of your purchase.</li>
      <li>Do all of this before the end of launch week, Monday August 13th, 2018 at 23:59 GMT.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you do the above then Su will refund your purchase price (0.5 ether) to your wallet address. Su and Will's wedding anniversary is right after launch week.</p>
