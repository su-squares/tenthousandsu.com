# Su Squares Open Sourced

*If you have any questions, please mail [Su@TenThousandSu.com](mailto:Su@TenThousandSu.com?subject=Su Squares&body=Hi Su%2C Please help! I have a question about Su Squares. ).*

## What is open source?

Open source software is computer software that is freely available for you to study, use, and implement as you like.

Su Squares includes several kinds of software, including the [smart contract](https://github.com/su-squares/ethereum-contract), [website](https://github.com/su-squares/tenthousandsu.com) and [backend code to build the website](https://github.com/su-squares/update-script).

It can be helpful to study these if you are building your own blockchain project.

## What is changing today?

A promise was made in the [Su Squares white paper](/white-paper) to open source all parts of the Su Squares project after 1,000 Squares were sold.

That milestone was just achieved today and we are immediately following through on our committment.

Starting today, all our software is entirely open source.
