# Su Squares Launches Monday August 6th, 2018

***Initial deed offering** starts Monday August 6th, 2018 and lasts one week until Monday August 13th, 2018. A special offer applies for people buying squares during launch week.*

*If you have any questions, please mail [Su@TenThousandSu.com](mailto:Su@TenThousandSu.com?subject=Su Squares&body=Hi Su%2C Please help! I have a question about Su Squares. ).*

## What are Su Squares?

Su Squares are cute little blocks which you can purchase and then attach a picture and website link to. It will show publicly on [the homepage](/). Once you own a Su Square, it is yours and your ownership is enforced by the Ethereum blockchain. You can sell or rent your Square to other people and trade as well.

We pay homage to [The Million Dollar Homepage](http://milliondollarhomepage.com/) and [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/).

Read more on [the white paper](/white-paper) to learn how it works.

## Initial deed offering / special offer

During launch week, anybody who purchases one square can receive an adjacent square for free. Here's how it works:

1. Purchase two adjacent squares using the same Ethereum account.
2. Personalize both squares with any picture, text and hyperlinks you like.
3. Do not transfer your ownership of those squares ("*hodl*") for the duration of launch week.
4. Email Su ([Su@TenThousandSu.com](mailto:Su@TenThousandSu.com?subject=Su Squares Launch Week&body=Hi Su%2C I purchased squares XXX and XXX using my wallet address XXX. Please refund my money for the launch week deal. And happy anniversary!)) and provide details of your purchase.
5. Do all of this before the end of launch week, Monday August 13th, 2018 at 23:59 GMT.

If you do the above then Su will refund your purchase price (0.5 ether) to your wallet address. Su and Will's wedding anniversary is right after launch week.
