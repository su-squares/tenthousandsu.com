# Su Squares Website

This source code runs the Su Squares website at https://tenthousandsu.com

## How it works

The square on this site is updated by https://github.com/su-squares/update-script other stuff is updated by commits into this repo and the site is published live using GitHub Pages. So commits immediately publish to the site.

## Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the project.

If you want to edit the [FAQ](/faq.md), stop reading. Just edit that file, I think you can figure it out.

For other files, please read the existing HTML. You will see that we try to keep it simple. No jQuery, avoid includes if possible. Minify images. We are designing the website for my grandmom, everything needs to be super clear.

## History note

At some point I may rewrite the git history so that it is linear and is one commit per blockchain block.

I know that git projects normally don't do that. This is special so I wanted to tell you up-front. This is probably a one-time thing.
