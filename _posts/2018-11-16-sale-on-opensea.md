# Su Squares For Sale on OpenSea

***Several squares in the middle are for sale at a discount [on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/susquares).***

## What is OpenSea?

OpenSea is a digital asset exchange which allows you to sell or transfer assets with zero fees. 

If you are the developer of a class of digital assets on the blockchain ("contract owner") then you are able to set a transfer fee which will be shared between the developer and OpenSea. This is how OpenSea makes money. Su Squares has set the transfer fee to 0% and we intend to keep it free for the foreseeable future.

OpenSea supports a variety of ways to sell digital assets, including fixed price sales, reverse auctions and bundle sales.

## What is for sale?

The original announcement on Twitter shows the squares for sale. This includes 12 squares sold individually and four sold as a bundle.
