    <h2>What are Su Squares?</h2>
    <p>Su Squares are cute little blocks which you can purchase and then attach a picture and website link to. It will show publicly on <a href="index.html">the homepage</a>. Once you own a Su Square, it is yours and your ownership is enforced by the Ethereum blockchain. You can sell or rent your Square to other people and trade as well.</p>
    <p>We pay homage to <a target="homage" href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com">The Million Dollar Homepage</a> and <a target="homage" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co">CryptoKitties</a>, and specifically, <a target="homage" href="https://github.com/dete">Dieter Shirley</a>.</p>
    <h2>Who would buy a Su Square?</h2>
    <p><strong>Anybody with a crypto-based business should advertise their business here.</strong> On this page you will reach like-minded individuals that can become your customers.</p>
    <p><strong>People that collect crypto-assets</stong> should buy a Square.</strong> This is a great vanity asset which you can fully personalize.</p>
    <p><strong>People that support ERC-721 and ownership of assets on the blockchain should buy a Square</strong>. Your purchase will help fund travel for the lead author of ERC-721 and everyone's vision for the blockchain revolution.</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="buy.html">Purchase a Su Square</a>, take ownership and keep it in your Ethereum wallet.</li>
      <li>Upload your image, text and hyperlink onto your square, it shows on <a href="index.html">the homepage</a> within one day.</li>
      <li>Transfer/resell your square to somebody else if you like.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Su Squares are an <a target="_blank" href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721"><strong>ERC-721 Deed</strong></a> that trades on the Ethereum blockchain. A specially-crafted smart contract ensures your exclusive and secure ownership of this square. Nobody, even Su, can take back a square that you own. The Su Squares project <a href="https://github.com/su-squares/ethereum-contract">hosted multiple public bug bounties</a> to pay anybody that could find any problem with the smart contract.</p>
    <p>The smart contract address is <strong><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xE9e3F9cfc1A64DFca53614a0182CFAD56c10624F" target="etherscan">0xE9e3F9cfc1A64DFca53614a0182CFAD56c10624F</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>Old versions of the smart contract are archived at 0xe264D16BCBA50925D0e1a90398596EC010306E14 and 0x6731560e455537c9f088EA02A47a0ECFa28a9231.</p>
    <p>The source code for the Su Squares smart contract is <a target="github" href="https://github.com/su-squares/ethereum-contract">publicly accessible on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>Will this website stay online?</h2>
    <p>We commit to keep this website online for at least ten years from our 2018 launch. We expect extreme interest in Su Squares and we will work hard to keep the website online. This website is under the jurisdiction of the United States of America. If for some reason it becomes impossible for us to continue hosting the site here we will move to a different jurisdiction or make any other temporary modification necessary to comply with local laws.</p>
    <p>After 1,000 squares are sold, we commit to open source the entire Su Squares project. This also includes all website code, backend code and image processing.</p>
    <h2>What is the cost?</h2>
    <p>The original cost for each Su Square is <strong>0.5 ether</strong> (<a href="https://ethereumprice.org/">current price</a> ~205 USD). You can buy any available Square for this price, and the price won't change. Every Su Square is the same price, so choose the best location on the page before it is sold!</p>
    <p>Once you own a Square, you may resell it at any price to third parties. You negotiate those deals however you like.</p>
    <p>It costs <strong>0.01 ether</strong> to personalize the square. The first three times are free.</p>
    <h2>Is this an investment?</h2>
    <p>Your Su Square entitles you to advertise your image/text/hyperlink on TenThousandSu.com. The Ethereum network and the Su Square ERC-721 smart contract ensure your access to the features. We believe this is an "advertising expense" for your company. But you should check with your lawyer, tax advisor and financial advisor before purchasing your Su Square.</p>
    <h2>If I own a Su Square, can I rent it out?</h2>
    <p>Yes. If you purchase a Su Square then you own that property. You can rent that to another person so that they can display any image/link/text they like on that 10x10 square. You can even set up a smart contract so that all this will be done and enforced by the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
    <h2>What happens if I lose access to my Square, can you get it back for me?</h2>
    <p>No. We do not have access to purchased Su Squares. This is enforced by the blockchain. We don't have any way to get it back. And the fact that we can't get it back is publicly knowable by inspecting our Su Squares smart contract on the blockchain.</p>
