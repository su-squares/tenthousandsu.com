# Frequently Asked Questions

*If you have any questions, please mail [Su@TenThousandSu.com](mailto:Su@TenThousandSu.com?subject=Su Squares&body=Hi Su%2C Please help! I have a question about Su Squares. ).*

## Can I buy multiple Squares together with PayPal?

Yes. Please purchase using Su Squares Homepage --> BUY --> PAYPAL. And then edit the URL to multiply the amount by how many Squares you would like.

In your PayPal note, please include:

- The Ethereum address to receive Squares
- Which Squares you would like
- What to do if your preferred Square is not available

PayPal orders are processed manually. Please be patient and ask with any questions.

After your order, you can expect:

1. Will finishes sleeping (if he's sleeping)
2. Will receives your order and personally processes it
3. You receive an email to your PayPal account address with confirmation just like when you buy shoes online
4. The Su Squares website is updated to reflect your order within 24 hours
