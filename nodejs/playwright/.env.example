# Network to test against (Ethereum, Sepolia, or Sunet)
NETWORK=Sunet

# Chain ID (required only for Sunet custom networks)
# For Sunet local devnet: CHAIN_ID=99999991
# For Sepolia: CHAIN_ID=11155111
CHAIN_ID=99999991

# Custom RPC URL (to connect with Sunet, Sepolia or Mainnet)
RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545

# Optional: Base URL for tests (defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4000)

# Square number for buy-square.spec.ts (1-10000)
## When E2E_MOCK_RPC=false, each Playwright project offsets this number by its
## project index (e.g., 500 -> 500, 501, 502, 503). If a number is already sold
## per squareExtra.json, the test scans forward from that offset (wrapping at
## 10000) to find the next available square.

# Square number for legacy-personalize.spec.ts (1-10000)
LEGACY_PERSONALIZE_SQUARE_NUMBER=1

# Top-left square number for legacy-personalize-batch.spec.ts (1-10000)
## Ensure there is sufficient space to fit a 40x40 grid of Squares (a block of four squares)
## so it won't fall outside of the Billboard grid space
LEGACY_PERSONALIZE_BATCH_SQUARE_NUMBER=1

# Square number for legacy-unpersonalize.spec.ts (1-10000)
## This is for personalization from the primary contract, NOT the underlay
LEGACY_UNPERSONALIZE_SQUARE_NUMBER=1

## Optional: square number not owned by the test wallet (for failure test)
# LEGACY_UNPERSONALIZE_FAIL_SQUARE_NUMBER=2
