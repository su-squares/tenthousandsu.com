      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When you own a Su Square NFT, you own a space on the homepage billboard corresponding to the number of your Square. Personalizing a Square is when you upload data (a title, link and small image) that gets associated with your Square on the blockchain, then that data gets automatically displayed onto the homepage billboard in your Square's spot. The homepage billboard updates hourly."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because that Square is not available. You are attempting to place an order that will revert. MetaMask could do a much better job of articulating this."

      "name": "Why are there two smart contracts? What's the underlay one for?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The underlay contract allows cheaper personalization transactions. Only the owner of a Square on the main contract can personalize it on the underlay. You use the underlay contract instead of the main one when you want your personalization to show up on the homepage billboard without paying full gas costs."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ERC-721 is the original Ethereum standard for NFTs. It ensures each token is unique, owned by only one wallet, and transferable across marketplaces. Su Squares uses an ERC-721 contract and was one of the first bona fide implementations."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Possible reasons: (1) the Square was personalized on the main contract which overrides new updates; (2) you personalized a different Square; or (3) the homepage hasn't updated yet—the billboard refreshes hourly."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Each Su Square is an NFT with a unique token ID from 1 to 10,000. That ID is also the Square number. Your token ID gives you a corresponding Square on the homepage billboard."
