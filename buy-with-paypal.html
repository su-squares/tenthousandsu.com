    <h1>Buy with PayPal</h1>

    <h2>Which Squares are eligible?</h2>
    <p>If a Square was already purchased, you can't buy it. Duh. See the homepage.</p>
    <p>The top-left Square and all adjacent (up/down/left/right) purchased Squares are called the <strong>electric fence</strong>. Squares adjacent to the electric fence are only available to <a href="buy">buy with Ether</a> on the homepage. In other words, you cannot buy those with PayPal.</p>
