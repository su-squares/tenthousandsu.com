    <h1>Buy with PayPal</h1>
    <p><em>For a limited time, and while supplies last<!-- (<span id="how-many-left">~~~</span> left)-->, some Su Squares are available to purchase with PayPal.</em></p>

    <p>Please mail <a href="mailto:Su@TenThousandSu.com?subject=Buy%20with%20PayPal&body=Hi%20Su!%0A%0AI'd%20like%20to%20buy%20Su%20Squares%20using%20PayPal.%0A%0AMy%20wallet%20address%20is%20XXXXXXXXXXX%0A%0AI%20would%20like%20Squares%20XXXXXXXXXXX%0A%0AIf%20those%20are%20not%20available%2C%20send%20me%20XXXXXXXXXXX">Su@TenThousandSu.com</a> and we will prepare an invoice for you.</p>

    <p>The current price is USD 1,200 per Square, which will increase to over 0.5 Ether.</p>

    <h2>Which Squares are eligible?</h2>
    <p>If a Square was already purchased, you can't buy it. Duh. See the homepage.</p>
    <p>The top-left Square and all adjacent (up/down/left/right) purchased Squares are called the <strong>electric fence</strong>. Squares adjacent to the electric fence are only available to <a href="buy">buy with Ether</a> page. In other words, you cannot buy those with PayPal.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/electric-fence.png" style="width: 600px; max-width: 80%;"></p>

    <!--
    <h2>How to buy?</h2>
    <p>Prepare a note with: your wallet address, which Square(s) you want, and what to do if your preferred Square(s) are not available.</p>
    
    <p>Click the <a href="https://paypal.me/fulldecent/1200usd">PayPal payment link</a>, then edit the URL and multiply by the number of Squares you would like.</p>

    <p>Now paste in your notes and send money.</p>

    <h2>After your order, you can expect:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Will finishes sleeping (if heâ€™s sleeping)</li>
    <li>Will receives your order and personally processes it</li>
    <li>You receive an email to your PayPal account address with confirmation just like when you buy shoes online</li>
    <li>The Su Squares website is updated to reflect your order within 24 hours</li>
    </ol>
